## 🙌 Project Personal Milestones

- Learned how to use the Java Swing UI components and its diferencies (advantages) against Java AWT.

- Structured game states evaluation functions for the purpose of determine winner, loser, score and general game states.

## 💡 Inspiration for creating this project

This assignment is my Computing Languages III course first exam. I enjoyed crafting it as it was a personal project long wanted to accomplish in other languages. However, it presented its own unexpected challenges. For example, I learned that organizing into a grid requires more lines and structure, but happens to be key and worth it in the long term.
